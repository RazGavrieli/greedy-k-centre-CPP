## INTRODUCTION
Simple project that implements a graph using CPP, and a greedy algorithm to approximate the location of K centroids in the graph. <br>
The algorithm attempts to minimize the maximum distance to the set 'centers' for each node in the graph. <br>
To run the algorithm simply clone the repository to your machine and run 'make', './main'. <br>
<br>
### THE ALGORITHM IS 2-APPROX.
